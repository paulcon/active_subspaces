        The length scale parameters (i.e., the rbf shape parameters) are

        techniques for fitting a Gaussian process model.

        The approximation also includes a monomial basis with monomials of
        total degree up to order `N`. These are fit with weighted least-squares,

        much better about it. Now I don't have to compute that silly
        prediction variance and try to pretend that it has anything to do with
        the actual error in the approximation. Also, computing that variance
        requires another system solve, which might be expensive. So it's both
        expensive and of dubious value. So I got rid of it. Sorry, Gaussian
