    **Notes**

    This class contains several convenient methods for working with active
    subspaces. These methods are mostly wrappers to other parts of the library.
    The methods are structured to be used with relatively little knowledge of
    how active subspaces work. At best, this class provides a useful surrogate
    for an expensive simulation with many input parameters.

    There are two ways to build the model: one that uses given data (see the
    method `build_from_data`) and the other that uses given interfaces to the
    simulation (see the method `build_from_interface`). With a simulation
    interface, the code is able to build response surfaces on its own design
    sets, i.e., its own choice of points. Also, the choices for building
    response surfaces are better with a given interface. However, one can still
    learn a great deal about the simulation from a set of input/output pairs.

    Once the model is built and the response surface is trained, one can use
    the methods to estimate the average, probabilities, and the minimum of the
    simulation quantity of interest as a function of the simulation inputs.

    If the model is built from given input/output pairs, then `Rsqr` is the
    R-squared coefficient from the response surface on the active variables. If
    the model is built from a given interface, the R-squared coefficient is
    computed from the output samples computed along with the gradients while
    estimating the active subspace. This is a big advantage of building the
    response surface with an interface.

            of the space of simulation inputs.

        **Notes**

        An ActiveSubspaceReducedModel cannot exist without knowing some
        information about the inputs to the simulation that the model is meant
        to represent. `m` tells the model how many inputs the simulation takes.

        There are two cases the code is set to handle respresented by the
        boolean variable `bounded_inputs`. If `bounded_inputs` is True, then the
        model assumes that the simulation inputs each take values in the
        interval [-1,1]. This implies that the domain of the simulation quantity
        of interest is the m-dimensional hypercube centered at the origin. In
        reality, the simulation inputs may take values in some other shifted
        and scaled hyperrectangle. We assume there is an implied shifting and
        scaling from the simulation's natural inputs to the hypercube. We
        assume that the hypercube is equipped with a uniform probability
        density function that is 2^(-m) on the hypercube and zero outside it.
        (We could talk for hours about whether or not this means that the
        simulation inputs are "random." But let's avoid that discussion for
        now.)

        The second case is when `bounded_inputs` is False. In this case, the
        simulation inputs are assumed unbounded. The simulation input space
        is equipped with a standard Gaussian density function. Again, this
        lets us compute integrals. The simulation's true inputs may be
        unbounded with some correlation. In this case, we assume that the
        inputs have been properly transformed to a standard Gaussian.

        response_surfaces.ActiveSubspaceResponseSurface

        **Notes**

        The default response surface is a radial basis function approximation
        using an exponential-squared (i.e., Gaussian) radial basis. The
        eigenvalues from the active subspace analysis are used to determine the
        characteristic length scales for each of the active variables. In other
        words the radial basis is anisotropic, and the anisotropy is determined
        by the eigenvalues.

        The response surface also has a quadratic monomial basis. The
        coefficients of the monomial basis are fit with weighted least-squares.

        In practice, this is equivalent to a kriging or Gaussian process
        approximation. However, such approximations bring several assumptions
        about noisy data that are difficult, if not impossible, to verify in
        computer simulations. I chose to avoid the difficulties that come with
        such methods. That means there is no so-called prediction variance
        associated with the response surface prediction. Personally, I think
        this is better. The prediction variance has no connection to the
        approximation error, except in very special cases. I prefer not to
        confuse the user with things that look and smell like error bars but
        aren't actually error bars.

        **Notes**

        This method uses the active subspace-enabled response surface to search
        for a minimizer in the simulation input space. It is only a heuristic.
        There is not guarantee that this method finds the true global
        minimum.
